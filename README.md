## 1. About the dataset

One way to understand how a city government works is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. This data contains the names,job title, and compensation for San Francisco city employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.

## 2. Assumptions assumed for the analysis

 Which job that have gained most overtime pay by year?

 What jobs that have gained more benefits by year?

 What relative and accumulated percentage of the 20 biggest jobs represent of the total value?
 What the most frequent of range pay by year?

 What the count of each job?

 What the average of payment by job and year?

 Which jobs have debts with the government?

An exploratory analysis of the data was carried out in order to verify null or empty values, which would have negative and distorted impacts on salary calculations.

Descriptive analysis to check the highest earners by group of positions, average salaries by type of position, gender and other measures.

Comparative analyzes to identify higher values per position, in addition to checking the evolution of payments during the analyzed period.
Creation of a graphic panel to demonstrate the results achieved.

With this information, it will be possible to measure where the highest salaries are being allocated, carry out other growth metrics and verify salary equity.
