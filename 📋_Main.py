### EXPLORATORY ANALISYS OF DATA

df1.info()

for column in df1.columns:
    unique_values = df1[column].unique()
    print(f'Unique values in {column}: {unique_values}')

df1.describe(include="all")

missing_percentage = df1.isnull().mean() * 100
print("Percentage of missing values for each column:")
print(missing_percentage)

### DROPING ROWS WITH NOT VALUABLE INFOS

df1.drop(columns='EmployeeName',inplace=True)
df1.drop(columns='Status',inplace=True)
df1.drop(columns='Notes',inplace=True)
df1.drop(columns='TotalPayBenefits',inplace=True)

### SETUP JOBTITLE COLUMN FOR UPPER

df1["JobTitle"] = df1["JobTitle"].str.upper()

### CLEANING OF NOT PROVIDED AND NAN ROWS

not_provided_jobs = df1['JobTitle'] == 'NOT PROVIDED'

df1.drop(df1[not_provided_jobs].index, inplace=True)

not_provided_basepay = df1['BasePay'] == 'Not Provided'

df1.drop(df1[not_provided_basepay].index, inplace=True)

df1 = df1.dropna(subset=['BasePay'])

### FILLING COLUMNS WITH NAN FOR ZERO

df1['OvertimePay'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
df1['Benefits'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
df1['OtherPay'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

### TRANSFORMING TYPE OF COLUMNS BASEPAY, OVERTIMEPAY, OTHERPAY AND BENEFITS TO FLOAT

df1['BasePay'] = df1['BasePay'].astype(float)

df1['OvertimePay'] = df1['OvertimePay'].astype(float)

df1['OtherPay'] = df1['OtherPay'].astype(float)

df1['Benefits'] = df1['Benefits'].astype(float)

### CHECKING TYPES OF ROWS
